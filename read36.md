## The Best Whiteboard Interview Advice I Ever Received

### 1. Communicate!

>  Actually the most important skill to prepare prior to an interview. Even if you think you understand the problem, you should take some very important steps before moving forward.

1. **_Restate the Question:_** Prove that do you understand what they’re asking you to do.

1. **_Ask About Edge Cases:_** Is it possible that the input would be a type other than a number? If so, what should the function do? Can the input be 0 or negative? Again, if so, what should the function do?”

1. **_Ask About Test Cases:_**  Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. 

1. **_Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense:_** It’s possible they will be the type that doesn’t want to “give you hints,” but it’s also possible they’ll be more interested in how you think and want to discuss your pseudocode with you. 

1. **_Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good:_** At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in. If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information without too much grief. If they give you trouble, just say you’ll leave it as pseudocode for now.

1. **_Stuck? Ask for Help!:_** “I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”

#### Communicating Prior to the Interview
You can ask if there is anything in particular you should prepare. They very well might give you hints like specifying the language in which they’ll ask questions, the number of questions, the style of question (e.g., develop an algorithm vs. find the bug). They might tell you whether you’ll be sitting at a computer or standing at a whiteboard — very useful information you might be able to use to practice or, at the very least, mentally prepare.
